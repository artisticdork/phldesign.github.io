### Useful Tips

* All CSS files can be accessed within `_sass/`.
* CSS files are written in `.scss` format and then jekyll compiles and outputs as `.css`
* The `_data` folder contains all of the agency, members, and events information. Feel free to add your information, add any agencies that are missing, tweak/edit/add any events.
