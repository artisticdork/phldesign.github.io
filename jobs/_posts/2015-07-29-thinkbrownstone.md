* Experience with evaluating web page performance and addressing issues (optimization)
* Experience using visual design applications (Photoshop, Fireworks, etc) to create assets for the web

* Comfortable working on the command line on Windows, Mac, and/or Unix/Linux
* Strong verbal and written communication skills, including experience with crafting documentation and technical presentations
