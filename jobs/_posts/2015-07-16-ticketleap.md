We’re a team of 26 people with high aiming goals centered around a belief that experiences, not things, are what make life great. We’re working on online ticketing that just works, and a tool for teams to track and share their in person moments.<!--more--> We’re profitable, growing, and are fueled by a culture that balances pride in what we’ve accomplished with a restlessness that we haven’t come close to fulfilling our potential.

At Ticketleap, you will have the opportunity to work on the web (Django and Python), on infrastructure (AWS), on our mobile products (iOS and Android), and whatever else may come along. Don't have experience in those technologies? That's fine. We strongly believe in hiring outstanding developers regardless of language experience. Syntax and frameworks can be learned quickly -- having the mindset and approach of a top developer is much more valuable (and harder to find).

### ABOUT YOU
* You're a full-stack developer with a minimum of 3 years experience
* You pride yourself on writing quality code
* Your work is better because you care why you're doing it
* You have empathy for the end user
* You believe that design matters. You can work with our design and UX resources to help, and are able to fill gaps on the small stuff.
* You're willing and able to quickly learn new technologies and codebases
* You're a team player and can plug into an existing highly functional group
* You connect with our vision of using events to build community
* You share our core values

### ABOUT TICKETLEAP
We've been at this events thing for a while (since 2007). We have thousands of customers using Ticketleap to sell tickets to their events and millions of customers using Ticketleap to buy them. It feels good to build something, deploy it, and immediately have people use it and give feedback. It feels even better to be aiming for goals much much higher.  At Ticketleap we believe that experiences are greater than things and we want more people to create and share events by empowering and inspiring the passionate people that make them happen.
